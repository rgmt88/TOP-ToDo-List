Properties of the todo-items, needs to be dynamically created
1. title
2. description
3. projects
4. dueDate
5. priority

ToDos need to be organized by projects

separate your application logic (i.e. creating new todos, setting todos as complete, changing todo priority etc.) from the DOM-related stuff, so keep all of those things in separate modules

use date-fns

store data locally using localStorage
